### Hey there! Welcome to asanaAI.
We created asanaAI inspired by various Machine Learning models for visual recognition. We have loved (almost) every second of this project and We have learnt more than We could have imagined. <br>asanaAI uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview" target="_blank">Pose.Net</a>, developed by Google’s TensorFlow, and <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for Machine Learning on the browser. Most of my learning was following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y" target="_blank">The Coding Train’s</a> YouTube playlist on Pose Estimation.
### For best experience set browser zoom level to 80% 
#### This web project is currently in development phase, we are working to improve its accuracy
